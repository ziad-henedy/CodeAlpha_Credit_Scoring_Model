# Credit Scoring Model
ðŸŒŸ Excited to share a project close to my heart from my internship at Code Alpha! ðŸš€

During my time there, I dove into creating something really impactful: a credit scoring model. But what does that mean in simpler terms? Well, it's like having a crystal ball that helps predict whether someone is likely to pay back a loan based on their financial history.

Using a fancy-sounding algorithm called RandomForest, I sifted through heaps of financial data. It was like piecing together a puzzle where every little detail mattered. After a lot of tweaking and testing, I made sure our model was as accurate as possible.

Why does it matter? Because it can help banks and lenders make fairer decisions about who they give loans to. And that means potentially opening doors for people who might otherwise struggle to get financial support.
